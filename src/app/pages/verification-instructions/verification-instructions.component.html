    Verification Instructions

  <p class="pt-2 text-justify">
    In order to verify the identity of your device, we utilize Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). PUFs take advantage
    of inherent manufacturing variabilities to uniquely identify each device based on its physical characteristics. To
    achieve this, we will need some data generated by the device you wish to verify. The following steps will guide you
    through this process.

    Step 1: Setting Up the Arduino Create Editor
  </h4>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Arduino boards use programs called sketches to control the functionality of the device. To extract the required data
    from your device you will need to run such a sketch on your Arduino. To do this you will first have to set up the
    Arduino Create Editor, essentially an online IDE that allows you to write sketches and upload them to your device.
    If you have not used the Create Editor before, please follow

    to set up the editor and familiarize yourself with the basics.

    use the “Import” button to add the data extraction sketch to your sketchbook. Then connect your Arduino to your
    computer and wait for the Create Editor to detect the device. Once a successful connection has been established, use
    the “Upload and Save” button to deploy the sketch on your Arduino.

  <h4 class="pt-3 pb-2">
    Step 4: Copy the required data from the Monitor in the Create Editor
  </h4>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Once the sketch has been successfully uploaded to the Arduino, access the serial monitor accessible under “Monitor”
    from the menu on the left. A data string should appear here. If this is not the case, make sure the serial port
    9600 is selected and try to disconnect and reconnect the device. Please copy the data string and proceed to the next
    step.
